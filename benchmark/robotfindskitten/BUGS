Current bugs:
-------------
When you hit the escape key, it takes about a second to register. Why?

	From the getch man page (Shazdeh <zen@emgnulation.org>):
-- 
       Use of the escape key by a programmer for a single charac-
       ter function is discouraged, as it will cause a	delay  of
       up to one second while the keypad code looks for a follow-
       ing function-key sequence.
--
	Also, you can now use Q to exit the simulation.

ncurses doesn't cooperate with characters less than '!'. It displays
them as, eg ^A for what should by rights be a little smiley
face. draw.h uses the A_ALTCHARSET flag. It doesn't work.

Occasionally, there are redraw errors.  Any ncurses gurus out there who can
clear this up?

	There's a chance that when I fixed the problem with noecho, it
	fixed this as well, but it hasn't been tested.

Possible Improvements:
----------------------
The code generally needs to be cleaned up.

Although the code should compile on anything that has ncurses, the
special character set used probably won't be handled correctly on
anything but Linux/Intel. Have an option to stick to standard ASCII.
[currently robotfindskitten is only standard ASCII.]


I think the list of messages should be in a text file which is read in
at runtime, so that people can easily change the messages.

The screen array is bigger than it needs to be. It probably shouldn't
be an array at all, actually, since at most 1/8 of the entries are
full. It should be a hash or something.
