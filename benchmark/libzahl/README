NAME
	libzahl - Big integer library

ETYMOLOGY
	The bold uppercase 'Z' which represents the set of
	all integers is derived from the german word 'Zahlen',
	whose singular is 'Zahl'.

DESCRIPTION
	libzahl is a C library for arbitrary size integers,
	that aims to be usable for robust programs, and be
	fast.

	libzahl will accomplish this by using long jumps
	when an error is detected, rather than letting the
	caller also perform a check. This shall make the
	code in the user program cleaner too. libzahl will
	use dedicated temporary bignum integers whether
	possible, and necessary, for its internal calculations.
	libzahl will not deallocate allocations, but rather
	cache them for reuse.

	With the exception of functions working with strings,
	all output parameters are before the input parameters.

RATIONALE
	GMP MP cannot be used for robust programs. LibTomMath
	is too slow, probably because of all memory allocations,
	and has a nonintuitive API. TomsFastMath has an a
	nonintuitive API, has limited precision (selected at
	compile-time), and has limited functionality. All the
	above are also bloated. Hebimath is promising, but I
	think it can be done better.

NOTES
	libzahl is currently not thread-safe.
