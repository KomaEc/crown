 * How bidding works for filters:
 *   * The bid manager initializes the client-provided reader as the
 *     first filter.
 *   * It invokes the bidder for each registered filter with the
 *     current head filter.
 *   * The bidders can use archive_read_filter_ahead() to peek ahead
 *     at the incoming data to compose their bids.
 *   * The bid manager creates a new filter structure for the winning
 *     bidder and gives the winning bidder a chance to initialize it.
 *   * The new filter becomes the new top filter and we repeat the
 *     process.
 * This ends only when no bidder provides a non-zero bid.  Then
 * we perform a similar dance with the registered format handlers.
