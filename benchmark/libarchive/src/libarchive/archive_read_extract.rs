 * This does quite a bit more than just copy data to disk. It also:
 *  - Creates intermediate directories as required.
 *  - Manages directory permissions:  non-writable directories will
 *    be initially created with write permission enabled; when the
 *    archive is closed, dir permissions are edited to the values specified
 *    in the archive.
 *  - Checks hardlinks:  hardlinks will not be extracted unless the
 *    linked-to file was also extracted within the same session. (TODO)
