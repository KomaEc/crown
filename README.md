# Crown (WIP)
__Crown__ serves as an ownership analysis tool dedicated for unsafe Rust code (typically those translated from C code) described by the paper [cav23](https://komaec.github.io/files/ownership.pdf). It has the optional functionality of refactoring, which can be found in the 'artifact' branch.
