//! Taint analysis for struct fields in a crate.
//! 
//! Given a crate with a set of C struct definitions, this analysis
//! produces flow-insensitive results on whether a field `f` (of pointer
//! type) of struct `S` may flow into a field `g` of struct `T`.
//! 
//! The taint analysis is essentially a field-based Steensgaard's analysis.
//! Struct fields initially point to pointer targets that represent those
//! fields. Assignment statements in the crate merge (directly or indirectly)
//! those targets. `S.f` may taint `T.g` if `S.f` and `T.g` are unified
//! in the analysis result.
