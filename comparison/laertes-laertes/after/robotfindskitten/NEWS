Robot Finds Kitten!

San Francisco, 2000 -- In a move that shocked the kitten-location industry, a
group of hackers in the monastery beneath the sea have constructed a zen
simulation that enables users with the premier kitten-finding robot technology.

"We feel that this is a great boon to those who are in danger of losing their
kittens, and wish to practice in the use of automated kitten-finding
equipment," said Leonard Richardson, chief kitten-finder to Zen master Ozdoba.
"We expect to be profitable by the third quarter of 2001."
