IMPORTANT!
robotfindskitten will NOT compile properly without ncurses headers
(libncursesN-dev in Debian GNU/Linux). Eventually ./configure will warn
you if you do not have it installed.

To compile, make sure you have the ncurses libraries installed, and 
simply type "./configure" and then "make".

To install, do the preceeding and then type "make install".

The program is called "robotfindskitten", and the documentation can be 
viewed by typing "info robotfindskitten" or "tkinfo robotfindskitten".  
The robotfindskitten binary is installed in $(prefix)/games 
(/usr/local/games by default on most systems).
